# Few-Shot Logo Recognition
## Objective
Train a few-shot logo detector which, starting from one or more images of the
logo to be recognized, is capable of retrieving all instances of the same logo from
a dataset.
## Dataset
LogoDet-3K-Dataset: https://github.com/Wangjing1551/LogoDet-3K-Datas 

## Experimental Plan
• Phase 1: Starting from a dataset of annotated images, design a proper
experimental plan (training, validation and test set, evaluation protocol
and metrics) suitable for designing.
• Phase 2: Establish a baseline using pre-trained models as embeddings.
• Phase 3: Refine the above-mentioned model with a suitable learning strategy for logo re-identification.
